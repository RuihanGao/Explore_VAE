# Explore_VAE
This repository implements autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), and conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and tests on MNIST dataset. <br/>

* Simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) structure is used and it is mainly for understanding purpose. <br/>
* Visualization is implemented, including latent space, KL between $p(z)$ and $q(z|x)$ distributions for VAE, and reconstruction. 
* A direct and fast check can be found in file `logs/Compare_AE_Collections_StaticPlot.pdf` and videos `logs/AE_ScrollBar.mp4` and `logs/VAE_ScrollBar.mp4`
